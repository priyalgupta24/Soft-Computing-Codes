# Soft-Computing-Codes

 This repository contains codes for various problems solved using Machine Learning Algorithms:- 
- **Spam-Ham-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes** :- Classifies mails to spam or non-spam, using the naive-bayes algorithm.
- **River-NonRiverClassifcation** :- Classifies whether a point in an image belongs to a river point or a non river point using **PCA(Principal Component Analysis)** algroithm.
- **Face-Recognition** :- Identifies people with the features of their face. The dataset consists of 10 face images each of 40 persons. The model is first trained on 70% images of each person and then testing is performed on remaining 30% images. The above problem is first solved using **PCA** for feature reduction and then the same is solved using both **PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis)** 
- **GDA** :- In this we apply **Gaussian Discriminant Analysis(GDA)** model on a microchip dataset and then use the same model along with **Bux-Muller Transformation** and compare the accuracy in both cases. We conclude that GDA works best for the data which follows gaussian distribution. (A comparative analysis report is also attached along with the two codes for better understanding.)
**Logic-Gates** :- Implementation of AND, OR, NAND ans NOR gates using perceptron.
